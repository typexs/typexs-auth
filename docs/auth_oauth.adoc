### OAuth


* Running Server for OAuth redirection
* User can select on the login page or the block the login-method he prefer
** There can be adapter which autheticate server-sided like database or ldap and
there can be adapter which authenticates client-side


Workflow for OAuth:

User gets login form
-> selects oauth base auth
-> redirects to oauth server
-> inputs login data
-> on positive the server redirects back to give redirect_url

TODO:


The form must be extended by selection of login-method.
